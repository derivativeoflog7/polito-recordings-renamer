Rename recordings from *<Lesson dd.mm.yyyy>/<Lezione del dd.mm.yyyy>...* to *<yyyy.mm.dd>...* to have them correctly sorted when viewing a directory sorted by names.  

Place all files to be renamed in a directory and launch the script.  
It will ask for a directory, perform a dry run listing the files and their target filename, warn in case of files not matching the pattern, and ask for confirmation before actually renaming all files.
