Rename recordings from *\<Lesson/Lezione del\> dd.mm.yyyy \<additional info\>* to *yyyy.mm.dd \<additional info\>* to have them correctly sorted when viewing a directory sorted by filenames.  

Place all files to be renamed in a directory and launch the script.  
It will ask for a directory, perform a dry run listing the files and their target filename, warn in case of files not matching the pattern, and ask for confirmation before actually renaming all files.
